This interactive bivariate web map displays nuclear, hydroelectric, and solar power plants within the
United States, symbolized by fuel source and energy output. The proportional circle symbols indicate
the amount of power produced from one fuel source. The user can click any blank area on the map to
visually filter power plants within 500 kilometers from the click location, then click on a power
plant location circle to display its attributes and distance from the original click point.
